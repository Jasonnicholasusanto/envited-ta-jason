Jason's Envited Technical Assessment

Hi, this is Jason. I am a final year undergraduate student majoring in computer and software systems, who is recently found interest in front-end engineering and within this 4 hours of coding for this TA, I found out new React techniques, design aspects and integrating the entire project into a working web-app interests me and I will continue to improve, learn and strive for the better in front-end engineering.

How to start the Web Application:
    1. cd envited-web-app
    2. npm start

How I would improve the product given more time:
    1. Integrate responsiveness into the website.
    2. Clean up code by grouping elements together to form a more reusable code and CSS elements. 
       Such as by having a parent component and utilising the inheritance principle in coding.
    3. Create more UI animations and responsive behaviour such as popping out buttons when user
       cursor hovers over it.
